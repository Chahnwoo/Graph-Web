The calculus content of the course is similar to 1/3 of the content covered in MATH 1106 and MATH 1110 . In addition, the course includes a variety of topics of algebra, with emphasis on the development of linear, power, exponential, logarithmic, and trigonometric functions. Because of the strong emphasis on graphing, students will have a better understanding of asymptotic behavior of these functions.",
